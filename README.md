# NLP-assignment
This exercise was done on Pycharm, I transferred it to anaconda and then to Github in order to transfer you the most comprehensible version possible. The explanations of my code can be found in comments.
In my code I compared the 4 models LogisticRegression, SVC(SVM), MultinomialNB and RandomForestClassifier to see which model had the best performance.
The results show , that, here the best model is the RandomForestClassifier(),with the "TF-IDF" vectorizer.
